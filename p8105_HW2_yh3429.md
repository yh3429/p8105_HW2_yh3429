## Problem 1

### To read and clean the NYC Transit data

``` r
NYC_transit = read_csv( "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

### A short description for this dataset

#### What variables the dataset contains

The dataset has 20 variables including line, station name, station
latitude, station longitude, served routes (`Route1`-`Route11`), entry,
entrance type, vending, and ADA compliance.

#### Description of the data cleaning steps so far

After importing the dataset, we cleaned the data name, specified that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7. And
then, we converted the `Route` variable from character to a logical
variable.

#### Giving the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. Are these data tidy?

There are 1,868 rows and 20 columns in the resulting dataset. And these
data is not tidy since the route number should be a variable. So, we
would need to convert `Route` variables from wide to long format.
