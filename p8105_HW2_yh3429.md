## Problem 1

### To read and clean the NYC Transit data

``` r
NYC_transit = read_csv( "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

### A short description for this dataset

#### What variables the dataset contains

The dataset has 20 variables including line, station name, station
latitude, station longitude, served routes (`Route1`-`Route11`), entry,
entrance type, vending, and ADA compliance.

#### Description of the data cleaning steps so far

After importing the dataset, we cleaned the data name, specified that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7. And
then, we converted the `Route` variable from character to a logical
variable.

#### Giving the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. Are these data tidy?

There are 1,868 rows and 20 columns in the resulting dataset. And these
data is not tidy since the route number should be a variable. So, we
would need to convert `Route` variables from wide to long format.

## Problem 2

### To read,clean, and organize the data from Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
Mr_Trash_wheel = read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                           sheet =1,
                           range = "A2:N550",
                           skip = 1,
                           col_names = TRUE,
                           col_types = NULL,
                           na = ""
                           ) %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
   drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
   mutate(sports_balls =  as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0))) %>% 
   mutate(sheet_name="Mr")
```

### To read, clean, and organize the data from Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
Pro_Trash_wheel = read_excel ("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                           sheet =2,
                           range = "A2:M97",
                           skip = 1,
                           col_names = TRUE,
                           col_types = NULL,
                           na = ""
                           ) %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
   drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
   mutate(sheet_name="Pro")
```

### To add an additional variable and combine two datasets

``` r
Pro_Trash_wheel = mutate(Pro_Trash_wheel, 
                         year = as.character(year)
                      )
comb_Trash_wheel= 
bind_rows(Mr_Trash_wheel, Pro_Trash_wheel, .id="dumpster")
```

### A paragraph description for these datasets

1.  In the combined trash wheel dataset, there are **641** observations
    of **15** variables.The key variables includes `dumpster`, `month`,
    `year`, `date`, `weight_tons`, `volume_cubic_yards`,
    `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`,
    `cigarette_butts`,`glass_bottles`,`grocery_bags`, `chip_bags`,
    `sports_balls`, `homes_powered`, and `sheet_name`. In addition, the
    variable `sheet_name` is added in order to distinguish the two
    datasets with the same columns.

2.  In the Mr. trash wheel dataset, there are **547** observations of
    **15** variables. The key variables includes `dumpster`, `month`,
    `year`, `date`, `weight_tons`, `volume_cubic_yards`,
    `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, `cigarette_butts`,
    `glass_bottles`, `grocery_bags`,`chip_bags`, `sports_balls`,
    `homes_powered`,`sheet_name`.

3.  In the Professor trash wheel dataset, there are **94** observations
    of **14** variables.The key variables includes `dumpster`, `month`,
    `year`, `date`, `weight_tons`, `volume_cubic_yards`,
    `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, `cigarette_butts`,`glass_bottles`,
    `grocery_bags`,`chip_bags`, `homes_powered`,`sheet_name`.

#### For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel?

``` r
Total_weight =  sum (Pro_Trash_wheel$weight_tons)
```

According to the sum result, the total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash wheel is **190.12 tons**.

#### For available data, what was the total number of sports balls collected by Mr.Trash wheel in 2020?

``` r
Total_sports_balls= Mr_Trash_wheel %>%  filter(year=="2020") %>% 
  summarise(sum(sports_balls))
```

According to the sum result in 2020, the total number of sports balls
collected by Mr.Trash wheel is **856**.
